* Top and bottom hodoscopes consisting of three detector layers made out of polyvinyl toluene.
* Muon tracking at each detector layer.
* Recording negative muon captures within the drum components including the steel layer, the concrete filling, and the solid uranium box.
* Uniform energy distribution between 0.1 and 8 GeV;
* One is supposed to use the executable+run1.mac without any change to employ the GEANT4 package appropriately;
* If/when necessary, one is supposed to remove/close the visualization macro (vis.mac) in run1.mac to prevent any possible computer crash.
