* Top and bottom hodoscopes consisting of three detector layers made out of polyvinyl toluene.
* Muon tracking at each detector layer.
* Recording negative muon captures within the drum components including the steel layer, the concrete filling, and the solid uranium box.
* Uniform energy distribution between 0.1 and 8 GeV.
